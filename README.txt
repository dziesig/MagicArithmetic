I created this program for my Granddaughter who, though she can solve Algebra
problems with ease, keeps making Arithmetic errors.

The program started as the "times tables" that I recall from grammar school,
but I expanded it to include Addition, Subtraction and Division as well.

I may add powers and roots as the need arises, but for now its Add, Subtract,
Multiply and Divide.
